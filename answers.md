1. Explain the difference between `Relational Databases` and `SQL`.

Relational Databases are made of tables containing different columns and rows. SQL is a computer language we use to manipulate said tables.

2. Why do tables need a `primary key`?

Tables need a primary key to make each item on the table unique. This assures each primary key is different for each row in a table.

3. What is the name given to a table column that references the primary key on another table.

The foreign key.

4. What do we need in order to have a _many to many_ relationship between two tables.

We need to make a third table to link between the two.
